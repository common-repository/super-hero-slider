Create cool slideshows easily and quickly

== Description ==

There are some great WordPress sliders out there with some great effects. The only problem is that it can take a lot of effort and expertise to produce those fantastic slideshows. Super Hero Slider is the only WordPress slider plugin where you can make amazing slides easily and quickly using WordPress post types and familiar controls.

Just take a look at [the demos](https://superheroslider.catapultthemes.com/).

= What is a hero slider? =

A hero slider extends the idea of a hero image, which is a large image usually placed at the top of your web page. With Super Hero Slider, you can present multiple hero images in sequence, using captions, transitions and animation.

= Super Hero Slider features =

Super Hero Slider gives you all the quality of the premium, ultra-popular image slider plugins for WordPress without the complications. Add images to slides using the standard WordPress media manager, add captions over the images using the default WordPress editor, and choose animation styles from dropdown boxes. There's no dragging and dropping or awkward animation timings to get right - the plugin lays everything out for you.

Features include:

**Simple interface**

Super Hero Slider is totally based on standard WordPress functions, like post types, and doesn't add any weird new interfaces like lots of slider plugins do. It's designed for anyone to use - if you can use WordPress, you can use Super Hero Slider.

**Animated layers**

Like any decent layer slider, Super Hero Slider lets you animate transitions between image _and_ animate captions and images on top of the main image.

**Drag and drop slide management**

I've tried to make it as easy as possible to use this plugin. Once you've created your slides you can re-order them using simple drag and drop.

**Fully extensible**

The plugin is developer-friendly. It has multiple filters and actions throughout for you to hook into if you want to extend its functionality.

**Deep linking**

You can create call to actions, e.g. links or buttons, that direct users from slides to pages within your site.

**Reusable slides**

Create a slide once and use it in multiple sliders.

**Multiple sliders per page**

There's no limit to how many sliders you can have on a page.

**WordPress responsive slider plugin**

Super Hero Slider will work on any device at any screen size.

**Touch and drag enabled**

Mobile users can swipe or drag slides.

**Replacing featured image with slider**

Assuming your theme uses the standard WordPress function `the_post_thumbnail` or `get_the_post_thumbnail`, then you can replace your page / post featured image with a slider with just one click. Most themes should use these functions to display featured images - if you're not sure, just check with your theme developer. I think this is the only WordPress slider plugin with this particular feature.

= How to get started =

When it's installed and activated, the plugin will create two new custom post types: Sliders and Slides. You can edit these in exactly the same way that you would edit a page or a post.

**Create a slider**

To create your first slider, just go to Sliders > Add New and give the slider a title.

**Create a slide**

To create a slide, go to Slides > Add New. Give the slide a title, upload an image, and add a caption. You can then assign the slide to one or more slides.

**Slider settings**

Once you've created a slider and a slide to go in it, you can specify some settings for your slider, including:

* Navigation position: define where to place the next and previous slide arrows, e.g left and right, bottom right, etc
* Navigation style: the style of the navigation buttons, including arrow shape and background shape
* Paginations: where to display the pagination dots
* Slide duration: decide how long slides should display before the next slide animates in
* Animation: define the transition animation, e.g. fade in, slide in, etc

**Slide settings**

You can add up to three layers to your slide image: e.g. some text, an image, and a call to action button. Captions use the standard WordPress editor so you can add any content you would to a normal WordPress post, even shortcodes.

You can choose different animations for each caption, e.g. fade in, slide in, zoom in, etc. There are about 30 animations to choose from. You can also set the timings so that the first layer animates, then the second, then the third...

**Adding a slider to your page**

The basic way to add a slider to your page or post is to use the `[super_hero_slider]` shortcode. However, you can also use the `super_hero_slider()` function in your theme files if you prefer. There's more information on adding sliders in [this support article](https://superheroslider.catapultthemes.com/adding-a-slider-to-your-page/).
